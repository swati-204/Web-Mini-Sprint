# Palindrome-checker
Welcome to the Palindrome Checker App project! This app is a part of my Web Mini-sprint where I built a tool to check whether a given string is a palindrome, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview
The Palindrome Checker App is a simple yet powerful tool that helps users determine if a string reads the same backward as forward, showcasing my skills in logic and problem-solving in web development.

## Features

- **Palindrome Checking:** Enter a string to check if it's a palindrome or not.
- **Interactive Interface:** User-friendly design for easy input and output.
- **Real-time Validation:** Get instant feedback on whether the input string is a palindrome.

## How to Use

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd palindrome-checker-app`
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
4. Enter a string and click the "Check" button to see if it's a palindrome.
