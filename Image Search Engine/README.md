# Image Search Engine
Welcome to the Image Search Engine project! This project is a part of my Web Mini-sprint where I built a dynamic image search engine using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This web application allows users to search for images using keywords. It leverages an API to fetch relevant images and display them in a visually appealing manner. The search engine offers a seamless and intuitive browsing experience, making it easy to discover and explore a wide range of images.

## Features

- **Dynamic Display:** Fetch images from an API and display them dynamically on the web page.
