# Number-Game

Welcome to the Number Game project! This project is a part of my Web Mini-sprint where I built an interactive game where players have to guess a number within a given range, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This web application provides an entertaining and challenging experience for players to test their guessing skills. The game prompts players to guess a number within a specified range and provides feedback on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct. Players can keep guessing until they correctly guess the target number.

## Features

- **Guessing Gameplay:** Players can input their guesses and receive feedback on whether their guess is correct, too high, or too low.
- **Random Number Generation:** The target number is generated randomly within the specified range for each game session.
- **Interactive Interface:** Enjoy a user-friendly interface that enhances the gaming experience.
- **Responsive Design:** Experience seamless gameplay across various devices and screen sizes.
