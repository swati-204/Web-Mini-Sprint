# Age-calculator
Welcome to the Age Calculator project! This project is a part of my Web Mini-sprint where I built a tool to calculate age based on the date of birth using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Overview
This web application allows users to input their date of birth and calculates their age accurately, incorporating learnings in handling future dates, date manipulation, and dynamic HTML updates.

## Features

- **Date of Birth Input:** Users can input their date of birth to calculate their age.
- **Accurate Age Calculation:** The calculator accurately calculates age in years, months, and days.
- **Dynamic HTML Updates:** HTML elements are updated dynamically to display age information.
- **Handling Future Dates:** The calculator handles future dates appropriately and displays informative messages.
