# QR-code-generator
Welcome to the QR Code Generator project! This project is a part of my Web Mini-sprint where I built a QR code generator using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an API.

## Overview

This web application allows users to generate QR codes for various purposes. With the QR code generator, users can create QR codes for URLs, text, contact information, and more.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/swati-204/Web-Mini-Sprint/qr-code-generator.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd qr-code-generator`
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- QR Code API: The QR codes are generated using the [QR CODE ] API.

## API Usage

To use the QR code generator, you may need to sign up for an API key from [QR CODE API]. Once you have obtained the API key, replace the placeholder in the JavaScript file with your actual API key.
